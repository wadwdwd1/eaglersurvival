# If you do wish to disable the rest api, you'll need to go into the config.yml set rest-api.enabled to false.

# For example if a player does not have permission to view their auctions, or the command is disabled. It will still let them!

  # The API may expose a lot of information that you may not want exposed, like exposing auctions.
  # To fix this, you can toggle this setting where the api will only expose the information that the player can already access.
  # Like for example, if a player makes an auction, they'll get the auction event. Another example would be where they can only get information for their auction object or player object.

  # The documentation link, this will be shown on the RestAPI website as well in-game, I highly suggest you setup your own documentation
  # so the developers know what IP address to use for the API and also including the endpoints.
